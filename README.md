# awslogcheck

The purpose is to create a tool to parse cloudwatch logs and get a mail report with all occurences that doesn't match with regexp given (like logcheck but for AWS EKS application, considering that logs are stored in cloudwatch thanks to fluentd).

Actually, the program can connect to AWS API through SSO profile or get the default config (need to give permissions to the EC2 that will run the program).

The check is done every hour. If there are logs that do not fit with rules, you will get an email (Need a mailgun account or an SMTP server).

# Configuration

The configuration files has the below format :

```
rulesdir: "/opt/awslogcheck/rules-perso"
imagesToIgnore:
  - fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset
  - 602401143452.dkr.ecr.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/eks/kube-proxy
  - docker:stable
  - docker:dind
containerNameToIgnore:
  - aws-vpc-cni-init
  - helper
  - build
  - svc-0
logGroup: /aws/containerinsights/dev-EKS/application
mailSubject: awslogcheck
mailTo: 
mailFrom:
mailgun:
  domain: 
  apikey:
smtp:
  server:
  port: 
  login:
  password:
  tls: true/false
```

imagesToIgnore and containerNameToIgnore are golang regexp expression, you can test with [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/)

One environment variable need to be declared :

```
AWS_REGION: eu-west-3
```

Every environment vars are mandatory. The loggroup should be the loggroup created by fluentd deployment. awslogcheck won't be able to check another structure of events.

## Execution 

### EKS (docker image)

Check the deploy folder to launch in kubernetes. 

### In command line (SSO)

Login into and specify the profile to use with option -p :

```
aws sso login --profile dev
awslogcheck  -g /aws/containerinsights/dev-EKS/application -t 3600 -c cfg.yml -p dev
```

### In command line (EC2)

You probably will have to set AWS_REGION :

```
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-3
awslogcheck  -g /aws/containerinsights/dev-EKS/application -c cfg.yml
```

Set the role below to get permissions from your EC2 to browse logs.

## Role for EC2

The program need permissions to consult cloudwatch. 

Policy example :

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [ 
                            "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                            "logs:GetLogEvents",
                            "logs:DescribeLogGroups"],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Create with AWS cli :

```
$ aws iam create-policy --policy-name EksEc2PolicyCloudwatch --policy-document file://EksEc2PolicyCloudwatch.json --profile dev
Policy:
  Arn: arn:aws:iam::.......................
  AttachmentCount: 0
  CreateDate: '.................'
  DefaultVersionId: v1
  IsAttachable: true
  Path: /
  PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount: 0
  PolicyId: ..........................
  PolicyName: EksEc2PolicyCloudwatch
  UpdateDate: '.................'
```

# Deployment in kubernetes

You have manifests example in the deploy folder.

## Development

This tool uses the aws sdk golang v2. [Here is the doc.](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2)

[Most of API calls use cloudwatchlogs.](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudwatchlogs)

# FAQ

If you have error like (when using the SSO) :

```
ERROR: operation error STS: GetCallerIdentity, failed to sign request: failed to retrieve credentials: the SSO session has expired or is invalid: expected RFC3339 timestamp: parsing time "2021-11-18T15:55:16UTC" as "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00": cannot parse "UTC" as "Z07:00"
exit status 1
```
